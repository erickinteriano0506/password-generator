# password-generator

I have made a simple password generator that creates a random password using various numbers letters and special characters.

Upon launch you will be prompted to enter how long you would like your password to be. It must be between 8-128 characters long.

Afterwards you will be asked to confirm if youd like uppercase letters, lowercase letter, and special characters.

Once you have confirmed the parameters, a password will be generated.
